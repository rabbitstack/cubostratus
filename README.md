**cubostratusc** (**c** stands for collector) is part of **cubostratus** - distributed instrumentation platform with emphasis on containers and microservice envrionments. It is still under heavy development.

cubostratusc acquires the syscall flow from the rock solid [sysdig's](https://github.com/draios/sysdig) driver and emits it to Kafka brokers for later ingestion, storage and analysis.
